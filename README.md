# nanofuzz-examples

A set of buggy example programs for playing with [NaNofuzz](https://github.com/nanofuzz/nanofuzz/) plus a tutorial that can typically be completed in under eleven minutes.

```
./
  tutorial/            NaNofuzz tutorial
  examples/            NaNofuzz examples
```

Several of the examples have bugs that may be detected using NaNofuzz' heuristic validator.
Other examples (e.g., roman, lcm, identitymatrix, modinv, normd) require human or property validators to identify some of the bugs.
